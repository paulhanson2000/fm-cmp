- Sample S1 has alleles TAA/TAAA and S2 TA/TA.
  - NOTE: I suppose S2 could also technically be considered to be T/T if you think about it,
    but in the context of this being an indel, is that still actually correct?... it's confusing.


- "bcftools norm -a" and "bcftools norm -a --atom-overlaps '*'" are equivalent.
  - I think I will avoid this (for now) because "*"s are a pain to deal with.
    That's not a good attitude though, I may have to come back to this to make the pipeline truly general for indels and all.
  - But... I think bcftools is incorrect anyway, right?
    S2 was TA/TA but it changed to T/T in row 1.
    Yeah, compare S2's GT in row 1 & 3, they are contradictory!! Am I seeing this correctly?

- "bcftools norm -m" (plus "-any", or whatever) seems bad for the same reason as mentioned here: https://stackoverflow.com/q/73611363
  - I.e., there are "0"s (ref allele) are used to fill in the missing spaces after decomp indiscriminately. It should be "." or "*".
  - This problem can be alleviated by adding "--multi-overlaps ."... or can it?
    - The output seems wrong. Look at a-bcftools_m_dot.vcf. Shouldn't S2's GT be 0/0 for the 2nd and 3rd rows too?
      I mean, it's technically not _incorrect_, but setting missing values where we _did_ have enough info to fill them in.

- "bcftools norm -a --atom-overlaps ."
  - Again S2's GT is wrong, see row 1 & 2 claiming S2's GT is T/T when it was TA/TA in the OG file.



IN CONCLUSION:
- None of this actually matters to me (yet) b/c there are only biallelics in the DIAMANTE data.
  dbSNP is the only one with multiallelics in my case, and these decomposition errors(?) don't affect rsIDs.
  However, was good to look into this to know what is correct.
- "vt decompose -s" is the ONLY correct one?!
